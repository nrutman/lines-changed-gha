# Lines Changed Summary Action

A GitHub Action that comments on pull requests with a lines changed summary (using GitHub's +/- style), with the ability to exclude files based on pattern matching.

This is useful when you want to get an accurate sense of the PR scope without counting generated files, lock files, or other files that don't meaningfully impact review effort.

## Features

- 📊 Posts a clean lines changed summary on PRs
- 🎯 Excludes files based on configurable patterns (e.g., `**/generated/**`, `*.lock`)
- 🔄 Updates the same comment on each run (no spam)
- 📁 Shows excluded and included files in collapsible sections
- 🔗 All filenames link directly to their diff in the PR
- ⚡ Fast and lightweight TypeScript implementation

## Usage

### Basic Example

```yaml
name: Lines Changed Summary

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  lines-changed:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: nrutman/lines-changed-gha@v1
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Exclude Generated Files

```yaml
- uses: nrutman/lines-changed-gha@v1
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    exclude-patterns: |
      **/generated/**,
      **/*.generated.ts,
      **/*.lock,
      **/dist/**
```

### Custom Comment Header

```yaml
- uses: nrutman/lines-changed-gha@v1
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    exclude-patterns: '**/generated/**,**/*.lock'
    comment-header: '## 📊 Code Changes (excluding generated files)'
```

## Inputs

| Input | Description | Required | Default |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `github-token` | GitHub token for API access | Yes | `${{ github.token }}` |
| `exclude-patterns` | Comma-separated list of glob patterns to exclude | No | `''` |
| `comment-header` | Header text for the comment | No | `## Lines Changed Summary` |

### Pattern Matching

The `exclude-patterns` input accepts glob patterns that follow the [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) syntax:

- `**/generated/**` - Exclude all files in any `generated` directory
- `**/*.generated.ts` - Exclude all files ending with `.generated.ts`
- `*.lock` - Exclude lock files in the root directory
- `**/*.lock` - Exclude lock files anywhere
- `**/dist/**` - Exclude all files in any `dist` directory

Multiple patterns can be combined with commas:
```yaml
exclude-patterns: '**/generated/**,**/*.lock,**/dist/**'
```

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `added-lines` | Number of lines added (excluding filtered files) |
| `removed-lines` | Number of lines removed (excluding filtered files) |
| `total-files` | Total number of files changed |
| `excluded-files` | Number of files excluded by patterns |

### Using Outputs

```yaml
- uses: nrutman/lines-changed-gha@v1
  id: lines-changed
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    exclude-patterns: '**/generated/**'

- name: Check if PR is too large
  if: steps.lines-changed.outputs.added-lines > 500
  run: echo "::warning::This PR adds more than 500 lines"
```

## Example Comment

The action will post a comment like this:

---

## 🟩🟩🟩🟥🟥 **+342** / **-128**

<details>
<summary><strong>Included</strong> (12 files, 85% of changes)</summary>

| File | Lines Added | Lines Removed |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| [`src/components/UserProfile.tsx`](https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123/files#diff-xyz123) | +45 | -12 |
| [`src/utils/helpers.ts`](https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123/files#diff-abc789) | +23 | -8 |
| ...

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Excluded</strong> (3 files, 15% of changes)</summary>

The following files were excluded based on patterns: `**/generated/**`, `**/*.lock`

**Total excluded:** +75 / -8 lines

- [`src/generated/api.ts`](https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123/files#diff-abc123)
- [`src/generated/types.ts`](https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123/files#diff-def456)
- [`package-lock.json`](https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123/files#diff-789abc)

## Development

> **⚠️ Important:** This action requires the `dist/` folder to be committed to the repository. GitHub Actions run the pre-built code directly and do not build the action at runtime.

### Setup

```bash
pnpm install
```

#### Configure Git Hooks (Recommended)

Set up automatic dependency installation for all git operations:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

This configures three hooks that run `pnpm install` when dependencies change:

**Git Hooks Included:**
- **`post-checkout`** - After `git checkout` or `git switch`
- **`post-merge`** - After `git merge` or `git pull`
- **`post-rewrite`** - After `git rebase`

All hooks are smart: they only run `pnpm install` if `package.json` or `pnpm-lock.yaml` actually changed, preventing unnecessary installations.

### Build

```bash
pnpm run build
```

This compiles the TypeScript code and bundles it with dependencies using `esbuild`. Always commit the `dist/` folder after building.

### Ensuring Build Files Are Always Up To Date

The CI workflow includes a dedicated job called **"Verify Build Files Up To Date"** that checks if the committed `dist/` files match the source code. This prevents merging changes when build files are outdated.

#### Enable Branch Protection (Recommended)

To **enforce** that build files are always up to date:

1. Go to your repository **Settings** → **Branches**
2. Add a branch protection rule for `main`
3. Enable **"Require status checks to pass before merging"**
4. Select the following required checks:
   - ✅ **Test, Lint, and Type Check**
   - ✅ **Verify Build Files Up To Date**

This will prevent merging any PR where the build files are out of date.

#### Optional: Pre-commit Hook

You can add a pre-commit hook to automatically rebuild before committing:

```bash
cat > .git/hooks/pre-commit << 'EOF'
#!/bin/sh
echo "Rebuilding action before commit..."
pnpm run build
git add dist/
EOF

chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

**Note:** This rebuilds on every commit, which may slow down your workflow. The CI check is usually sufficient.

### Testing Locally

To test the action locally, you can use [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) or create a test repository and reference your branch:

```yaml
- uses: nrutman/lines-changed-gha@your-branch-name
```

## Publishing

**Important:** GitHub Actions require the compiled `dist/` folder to be committed to the repository. The action runs the pre-built code directly without building itself.

1. Build the action:
   ```bash
   pnpm run build
   ```

2. Commit all changes including the `dist/` folder:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Build action"
   ```

3. Tag and push:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1 -m "Release v1"
   git push origin main --tags
   ```

**Note:** The CI workflow automatically verifies that the `dist/` folder is up to date on every PR. To prevent merging outdated builds, enable branch protection rules (see Development section above).
